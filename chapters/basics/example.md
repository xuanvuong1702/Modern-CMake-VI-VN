# A simple example

This is a simple yet complete example of a proper CMakeLists. For this program, we have one library (MyLibExample) with a header file and a source file,
and one application, MyExample, with one source file.

```{literalinclude} ../../examples/simple-project/CMakeLists.txt
:start-after: "[main]"
:end-before: "[main]"
:language: cmake
```

The complete example is available in [examples folder](https://gitlab.com/CLIUtils/modern-cmake/tree/master/examples/simple-project).

A larger, multi-file example is [also available](https://gitlab.com/CLIUtils/modern-cmake/tree/master/examples/extended-project).
